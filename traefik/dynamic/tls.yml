# Traefik TLS configuration – Cloudflare Origin Certificate
#
# This file is loaded by the file provider (dynamic config directory).
# It sets the Origin Certificate as the default TLS certificate for all
# HTTPS connections, enabling Full (Strict) SSL mode in Cloudflare.
#
# The certificate files must be placed in traefik/ssl/ before starting Traefik:
#   traefik/ssl/origin-cert.pem  →  /etc/traefik/ssl/origin-cert.pem
#   traefik/ssl/origin-key.pem   →  /etc/traefik/ssl/origin-key.pem
#
# See traefik/ssl/README.md for instructions on obtaining the certificate.
